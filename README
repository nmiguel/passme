# About this tool

Passme is a tool for copying and managing tokens or passwords. It is not secure and does not encrypt the data, this may be implemented in the future, but if this is a concern for you, you should not use this tool.
This tool is designed to be used when asked for a password or token. Simply background the current task or use a separate tab or split to quickly get this token into your clipboard, ready to be pasted.
